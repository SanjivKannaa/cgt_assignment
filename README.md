## Problem Statement
- PROBLEM 6 => Implementation of cut vertices and separability

## Algorithim
- Get the vertices
- Get the edges
- Form adjacency matrix
- Loop through the vertixes
    - remove the vertex
        - Use DFS and check if the graph is connected
        - if connected
            - mark that the graph is seperable
            - print the vertex name
